    "Have a quick look at the following OCaml tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "## REPLs (Read Eval Print Loops)\n",
    "\n",
    "### ocaml\n",
    "\n",
    "Simply type your OCaml code. If you want the REPL to execute your code, type `;;`. Execute the content of a .ml file with `#use \"<filename>\"`. To exit the REPL enter `#quit` or type `Ctrl + D`. Note that `#use`, `quit` as well as `;;` are special sequences recognized by the REPL and are not part of OCaml (so do not use them in a .ml file).\n",
    "\n",
    "### utop\n",
    "\n",
    "utop works in the same way as ocaml, but is more comfortable as it comes with autocompletion, for example, and allows you to change or redo previously typed code much more easily.\n",
    "\n",
    "## IDEs\n",
    "\n",
    "### Visual Studio Code\n",
    "\n",
    "Visual Studio Code is a free full-fledged integrated development environment for a lot of programming languages, due to its great extensibility and rich set of existing extensions. The OCaml plugin together with merlin and ocp-indent provides great utilities\n",
    "\n",
    "* syntax highlighting\n",
    "* autocompletion\n",
    "* smart identation\n",
    "* peek and goto definition\n",
    "* type information \n",
    "* immediate error reports\n",
    "* integrated terminal\n",
    "* and much more ...\n",
    "\n",
    "## Compilers\n",
    "\n",
    "### ocamlc\n",
    "\n",
    "ocamlc is a basic ocaml compiler. When invoked as `ocamlc <file-0> ... <file-n>` it compiles all files into an executable named `a.out`. During this process, `.cmi` and `.cmo` files are generated, representing the compiled interface and object files respectively. Check the documentation (http://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/manual-ocaml-4.00/manual022.html#toc86) for a list of all command line options and more advanced build steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ocamlbuild\n",
    "\n",
    "ocamlbuild is a more convenient compilation utility, as it resolves and compiles dependencies automatically. In order to build your project with ocamlbuild, simply compile your main file `<file>.ml` with either `ocamlbuild <file>.d.byte` or `ocambuild <file>.native` to produce bytecode (with debug information) or native code, respectively. Check the documentation (https://ocaml.org/learn/tutorials/ocamlbuild/) for more details.\n"
