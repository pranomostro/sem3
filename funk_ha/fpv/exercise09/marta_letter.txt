Hello, dear naughty child. Yesterday, I watched a little sketch
where a couple of people sit in a room in front of a whiteboard.
On the whiteboard one can see the word rapist, and some
other word covered with paper above it. The person standing
in front asks: 'What is worse than a rapist?', and then
reveals the word 'child' above. The audience gasps, and
a man in the background audibly murmurs: 'A child'.
